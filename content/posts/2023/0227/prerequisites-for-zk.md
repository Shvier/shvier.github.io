# Preface
I started my research on ZKP last month. There were many unfamiliar math concepts for me, such as group, order, elliptic curve, etc., and I couldn't fully understand them even with the help of my professor. After struggling for several days and reading some papers, I want to construct my knowledge base in this field. My best bet is to rephrase these contents like excuting rubber duck debugging. This is why I decided to write a series of articles to help me review the ideas.
This page is aiming at introducing jargon and explaining them with examples. For some complicated concepts, I'll illuminate the topics with more papers.
