The protocol was intuitive when I first read it, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t think about the details thoroughly. When I was designing a protocol of proof of solvency, I wanted to compare the pros and cons of the existing designs. So this post came out.
KZG commitment KZG is one of the most prevalent polynomial commitments. It is widely used in generating proof of zero knowledge.</description></item><item><title>Prerequisites for Zero-Knowledge Proof</title><link>https://shvier.github.io/posts/2023/0227/prerequisites-for-zkp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 16:49:24 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://shvier.github.io/posts/2023/0227/prerequisites-for-zkp/</guid><description>Preface I started my research on ZKP last month. There were many unfamiliar math concepts for me, such as group, order, elliptic curve, etc. After struggling for several days and with the help of my professor, I understood them gradually. Now I want to construct my knowledge base in this field. My best bet is to rephrase these contents like executing rubber duck debugging. This is why I decided to write a series of articles to help me review the ideas.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://shvier.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shvier.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Barry.
